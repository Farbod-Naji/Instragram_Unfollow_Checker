as of Feb 2023, this code works with instragram website.

The program take both system argument input and also command line inputs.
However If you want you password to show hidden, use command line inputs.

system argument input:
    python main.py [Username] [Password]
command line inputs:
    ====> python main.py
    The number of system inputs is too few.
    Please re-enter your login information
    login: [Username]
    Password: [Password]
